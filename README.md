# Nexe Example

In order for Nexe to work, you need to ensure that you can first build Node from source. To do this, you will need to download three items:

* [Python 2.7](https://python.org/downloads/)
* [NetWide Assembler](https://nasm.us/)
* [Visual Studio 2017 build tools](https://google.com/search?q=visual+studio+2017+build+tools+download)

Important; be sure to add Python and NASM to your [environment variables path](https://google.com/search?q=add+to+environment+variables+path)!
